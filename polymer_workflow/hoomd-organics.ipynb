        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "This notebook provides interactive examples that will assist learners in using MoSDeF tools to:\n",
        "1. Initialize complex macromolecules for molecular simulation.\n",
        "2. Demonstrate how to run HOOMD-Blue simulations with these molecules.\n",
        "3. Use and inspect forcefields.\n",
        "4. Generate coarse-grained representations and run simplified models.\n",
